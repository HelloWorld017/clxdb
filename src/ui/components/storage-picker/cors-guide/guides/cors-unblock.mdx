## Introduction

CORS Unblock is a browser extension that grants cross-origin access per host. This is useful when you cannot edit the storage server CORS rules directly.

## How-To

1. Install CORS Unblock for your browser: [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/odkadbffomicljkjfepnggiibcjmkogc), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-unblock2/), or [Safari](https://apps.apple.com/en/app/cors-unblock/id6744779652).
2. Reload this app (current origin: <LocationOrigin />).
3. Retry the storage action and approve the requested host permission when the extension prompt appears.
4. Retry again and confirm requests succeed.
5. Manage or revoke granted hosts from the CORS Unblock extension UI.
